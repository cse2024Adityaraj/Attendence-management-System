****The project solves the goal of controlling a university students' attendance on courses based on her student id, being a Mifare SmartCard given a unique ID, that can be unambiguosly mapped to the student's id.



















 This project gathers all implementations and documentations that were the result of my Engineer's 
 Thesis project. Should you be interested in a more reader-friendly version of my work,
